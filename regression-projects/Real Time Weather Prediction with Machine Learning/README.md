# Background
Real-time weather forecasting is vital in South Africa for disaster management <i>(floods, droughts)</i>, 
protecting lives, supporting key economic sectors like agriculture, energy, and transport, and helping daily life planning, 
especially given the country's varied climate, increasing extreme events, and reliance on rainfall for food security.

# Project Description
This project makes use of a machine learning model to predict the temperature and humidity for the next five hours for any city in South Africa. 
It also displays the current weather data <i>(e.g minimum temperature, maximum temperature, possibility of rain etc)</i>. 
The dataset used in this project to train the model is synthetic (fake). 

# Tools Required
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.10 or greater</li>
  <li>An IDE <i>e.g Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Spyder etc</i></li>
</ul>

# Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>Strong knowledge of Python and relevant libraries such as <i>Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn</i> for data manipulation, numerical operations, and model building is essential.</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of a Linear Regression model</li>
  <li>Knowledge of time series concepts</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
