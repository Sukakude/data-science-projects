# Titanic Kaggle Competition
In this challenge, we have been asked to build a 
predictive model that answers the question: 
“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” 
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

# Datasets
<strong>Train.csv</strong> will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
<strong>test.csv</strong> dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
